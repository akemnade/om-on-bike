3D models for attaching a GTA02/GTA04 to a freerunner

freerunner-holder.scad:

bicycle holder for the GTA02/GTA04
It was printed using high-temperature pla.
I cut off the upper parts of a bell and drilled two holes
for the m4 screws to mount the plastic on it.

usb-holder.scad: 

I attached a double usb socket (series MUSB-C111 from Amphenol) to that.
I printed the main part using soft pla so it can be bended well. The 
thin part was printed using harder material.
